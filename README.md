### An overview of the site

* Our first step was to create all the HTML pages of the company's SitMe site, matching the design as closely as possible to what we did in Part 1.


* We created an HTML file for each page on the site and categorized each element according to the sketches we created in the previous section.


* We created a header and footer common to all the pages and pasted the same code on each separately.


* A site navigation menu appears at the top of the page in the header. It contains a company logo, order history, map, about page, and a login / register forms.


* In the footer, you will find the company logo, address, order history, map, about page of the site and links to companies with which SitMe cooperates.


* We then created a custom CSS file for each page. On all pages of the site, we used a uniform design, palette, and font. Additionally, we have added CSS pages for forms that vary according to the various elements in the UI we designed in the previous task.


* Clicking the company logo in the header will take you back to the home page.


* In order to make browsing the site easier for our customers, we have added a "back to top" button at the bottom of each page.
