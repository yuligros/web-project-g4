An overview of the site - 
Our first step was to create all the HTML pages on the company's SitMe site, matching the design as closely as possible to what we did in Part 1. We created an HTML file for each page on the site and categorized each element according to the sketches we created in the previous section.
We created a header and footer common to all the pages and pasted the same code on each separately.
A site navigation menu appears at the top of the page in the header. It contains a company logo, order history, map, explanation of the site, and a login / register button.
 In the footer, you will find the company logo, address, order history, map, explanation page on the site and links to companies with which SitMe cooperates.
We then created a custom CSS file for each page. On all pages of the site, we used a uniform design, a uniform color palette, and a uniform font. Additionally, we have added CSS pages for forms that vary according to the various elements in the UI we designed in the previous task.
Clicking the company logo in the header will take you back to the home page.
In order to make browsing the site easier for our customers, we have added a "back to top" button at the bottom of each page.
