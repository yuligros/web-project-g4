    <p ><strong><span >Part I - Reservation Services</span></strong></p> 
     
    <p ><span >1. 
    &nbsp;<strong><span >Restaurant Reservations</span></strong>. 
    SitMe makes available restaurant reservation services (the “<b>Reservation 
    Services</b>”) and waitlist services (the “<b>Waitlist Services</b>”) through 
    the SitMe Sites to User for the purpose of assisting User in securing 
    dining reservations or joining a waitlist at participating third-party 
    restaurants (each, a “<strong><span >Restaurant</span></strong>”). 
    In response to a User’s online request for a Restaurant reservation or to join 
    a waitlist through the SitMe Sites, SitMe contacts the Restaurant’s 
    computerized database of reservations and waitlists, as applicable. The 
    availability of reservations, estimated wait time or place in line on a 
    waitlist is determined at the time of User’s query and based on information 
    provided to SitMe by the Restaurant. Once a reservation or waitlist request 
    is made by User through the SitMe Sites, SitMe will provide 
    confirmation of the reservation or waitlist status to User by email or other 
    electronic messages as has been agreed to by User. By using the Reservation 
    Services or Waitlist Services, User agrees to receive reservation and waitlist 
    confirmations, updates, modifications and/or cancellations by email or other 
    electronic messages.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >2. 
    &nbsp;<strong><span >No-Show Policy</span></strong>. 
    SitMe is committed to providing superior quality services to Users and 
    Restaurants. To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service 
    for the Restaurants and their patrons, Users must cancel any reservations that 
    they will be unable to honor at least 30 minutes in advance of the reservation. 
    You may cancel your reservation via the SitMe Sites or by calling the 
    Restaurant directly. Some Restaurants may require a debit or credit card number 
    to finalize your reservation.&nbsp; In order to use the Reservation Services 
    for these Restaurants, you must provide valid debit or credit card information. 
    To confirm that the debit or credit card information you have provided is 
    accurate, we may place a temporary authorization on your debit or credit card 
    at the time you provide your debit or credit card information. After we verify 
    that your debit or credit card information is accurate, usually within a few 
    days, the authorization will be removed. You may be required to cancel your 
    reservation in accordance with the Restaurant’s cancellation policy, which is 
    disclosed at the time the reservation is made. SitMe uses this debit or 
    credit card information as described in our<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><a 
    href="/legal/privacy-policy?updated=true&amp;lang=en"><span 
    >privacy policy</span></a><span 
    class=apple-converted-space><span >&nbsp;</span></span><span 
    >and shall have no liability for any 
    charges made to the debit or credit card account for any failure to cancel your 
    reservation in accordance with a Restaurant’s cancellation policy.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >If 
    you are unable to keep your reservation and you fail to cancel at least 30 
    minutes in advance of the reservation, SitMe will send you an email letting 
    you know that our records indicate that you were a no-show. Upon arriving at 
    the Restaurant, it is the User’s responsibility to notify the host that the 
    User has a reservation. By using the Reservation Services, User agrees to 
    receive no-show notifications by email after a report that your reservation was 
    not honored, whether or not that was in fact the case. Your Account will be 
    suspended if you are a no-show for four reservations within a 12-month period. 
    If you receive a no-show notification email in error, please<span 
    class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><a 
    href="http://support.SitMe.com/"><span >click here</span></a><span class=apple-converted-space><span 
    >&nbsp;</span></span><span 
    >for information on how to dispute it. 
    User agrees that all final no-show determinations will be made by SitMe in 
    its sole discretion.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >If 
    you wish to remove yourself from a waitlist you have joined through the 
    Waitlist Services, you can do so by managing your place in line through the 
    SitMe Sites or by calling the Restaurant. Failure to appear at the 
    Restaurant in a timely manner may result in the Restaurant bypassing your place 
    on the waitlist for other guests or removing you from the waitlist entirely.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >3. 
    &nbsp;<strong><span >SitMe Dining Rewards</span></strong>. 
    Depending on your country of residency, you may be able to participate in 
    SitMe’s rewards program (“<strong><span >SitMe 
    Dining Rewards</span></strong>”). Where applicable, participation is subject to 
    the<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><a

    Conditions</span></a><span >.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >4. 
    &nbsp;<strong><span >Usage Guidelines</span></strong>. 
    User agrees to use the Reservation Services or Waitlist Services only to book 
    reservations or join waitlists at Restaurants and then honor those reservations 
    or waitlist requests by arriving at the Restaurants on time and ordering and 
    paying for meals. User further agrees not to book more than one reservation or 
    join more than one waitlist for User’s personal use during any one meal time 
    (e.g., lunch, dinner, etc.). Administrative assistant and/or concierges may be 
    able to book multiple reservations through SitMe’s Administrative Assistant 
    and/or Concierge programs, subject to any applicable program terms. Resale or 
    attempted resale of reservations or waitlist spots is prohibited and is grounds 
    for, among other things, cancellation of your reservations, removal from the 
    waitlist or termination of your access to the Services.&nbsp;</span></p>

    you are a resident of the United States (including its possessions and 
    territories) or Canada, you agree that any and all controversies, disputes, 
    demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and 
    scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, 
    count, claim, or cause of action) between you and the SitMe Parties or 
    their successors or assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and 
    confidential arbitration. If you are a resident in Mexico, you hereby expressly

    shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state or

    before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving 
    commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“<strong><span 
    >AAA</span></strong>”). As modified by this 
    Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the 
    arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><a

    <p ><span >In 
    the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you are thus agreeing to 
    GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for 
    matters that you file in small claims court. Your rights will be determined by 
    a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a&nbsp;<u>FAIR 
    HEARING</u>, BUT the arbitration procedures are&nbsp;<u>SIMPLER AND MORE 
    LIMITED</u>&nbsp;THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as 
    enforceable as any court order and are subject to&nbsp;<u>VERY LIMITED REVIEW</u>&nbsp;BY 
    A COURT.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >In 
    the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you and SitMe must 
    abide by the following rules:&nbsp;(1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR SitMe 
    MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND&nbsp;<u>NOT AS A 
    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER</u>&nbsp;IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE 
    PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S 
    CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS 
    PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (3) in the event that you are 
    able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as 
    compared to costs of litigation, SitMe will pay as much of your filing and 
    hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems 
    necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to 
    the cost of litigation; (4) SitMe also reserves the right in its sole and 
    exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the 
    arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy 
    recognized at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you 
    nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, 
    except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the 
    arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or 
    individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side 
    pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision 
    that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, 
    and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the 
    applicable law.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >Notwithstanding 
    the foregoing, either you or SitMe may bring an individual action in small 
    claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud 
    and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s 
    patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration 
    agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal 
    courts located in San Francisco County, California. Additionally, 
    notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency 
    equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco 
    County, California in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and 
    hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts 
    located within San Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for 
    interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</span></p> 
     
    <p ><span >With 
    the exception of<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>SitMe 
    Parties (1) and (2) in this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or 
    collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be 
    invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and 
    Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in 
    effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, 
    unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, 
    however, either subpart (1) or (2) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or 
    illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and 
    void, and neither you nor SitMe shall be entitled to arbitration. If for 
    any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration (including any 
    claims brought by parties outside the United States or Canada), the dispute 
    shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in San Francisco 
    County, California.</span></p>

    accordance with the laws of the State of California, U.S.A, consistent with the
